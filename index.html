                                Loved meeting our hostess Chloe who helped us out with whatever we need. Very friendly staff and always happy to help. 
                                Spectacular game drives with our ranger and the food was delicious. Would recommend taking your own shampoo.

                                Great trails and hiking. Outstanding views, sadly we only had two clear days but it was well worth it! 
                                Very comfortable stay, we loved the decor in our room and we had more amenities than we would need. 
                                Definitely would recommend!

                            Beautiful location overlooking the incredible ocean. If you are looking for a romantic get away this is definitely one I recommend.
                             We stayed at Benguerra Island and couldn't believe how spectacular the stars looked!

                            Beyond what we had hoped for a family holiday, really enjoyed the beach. It was quieter than expected and all in all a fantastic stay.
                            The entire team looked after us so well and the kids had a blast swimming in the ocean.
