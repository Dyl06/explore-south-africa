        - The background is white allowing for the clean and crisp feel that runs throughout the site. Background and font work seemlessly together allowing for user optimisation and enjoyment.

## Destination Pages ##
        - The three destination pages namely: Safari, Beach and Mountain all follow the same structure to provide users with a consistent and easily understandable experience. This includes color and font styles. 
        - The consistency gives value to the user by allowing them to quickly gain understanding of how the site works, making it feel very intuitive and leaving the user with a positive experience. 
        - Each section begins with a description of the specific destination which the user may be interested in, which helps to achieve the purpose of the site by directing users in the direction of booking their holiday. 
        - These sections are all a bit longer and more informative for the user who might not yet be sure or may want to compare the different destinations to make the best choice for them when booking their holiday. The menu at the top of the page again allows users to quickly and intuitively navigate through the different destinations or directly to the booking page. 
        - Bellow all of the information sections is a gallery showcasing some the highlights from each of the destinations. The top of the gallery is visible on the same page as the destination information encouraging users to keep scrolling. The purpose of this is to showcase some of these amazing images knowing it will make users more excited about going on holiday and experiencing the same things they are seeing in these images. Leaving users feeling positive about the sight and their experiences of it.

     - The form is very simple and easy to fill out, making use of autofill for most of the sections. 
     - The book now button at the bottom is obvious and easy to find. styling fits in with book now buttons from the home page. Giving users more of a peace of mind and making the site very intuitive. 
     - Form sections have been kept to a bare minimum not wasting any time and keeping users engaged and interested in the site.

![Book Now page and form](assets/images/booking-form.png)
<br>
## Features left to implement ##
    - In future I would like to implement book now buttons at the bottom of each of the destination pages, to allow quicker and easier booking for thos looking at these pages.
    - I would also like to make the header stay fixed at the top of the page and have the content slide under it as you scroll down each page, so the menu is constantly available and a easy click away. 

# Testing #
#### Original Plans ####
The original testing came in the form of drawn plans on paper to try and plan out how exactly I wanted the site to look and then how I was going to achieve that using different containers and methods to do this. All these plans were tested using html and css. Below are photos of those plans as well as my final container I decided to use. 
![home original](assets/images/original-home.JPG)
![home page plan](assets/images/home-page-plan.JPG)

![about us and review plan](assets/images/about-and-review-plan.JPG)
![final destination section container divs](assets/images/destination-section-container.png)
#### Physical Testing ####
All testing was done using iphone, samsung galaxy, pixel 5 ipad, surface-pro, nest hub and laptop and tv screens. 
![destination section not aligned](assets/images/destination-not-aligned.png)
- During testing the css to align the destination column was very difficult as there was a different amount of text in each. So giving it a height value of auto made it sit un-aligned. 
- I tried giving it a fixed value but this either made it have to big a gap between the text and the button or once the screen size got smaller the text would overlap the button and not work properly. 
- To solve this I ended up using a fixed value and then used media queries to adjust the height until I turned the column into rows where i could then use a height of auto again which made the content fit well. 
- While switching from column to row was good for the text content on bigger screens the width of the images in the destination sections became to wide and stretched the images badly. 
- I used media queries and instead of having 100% width I used 60vw @ max-width 1024px and then 80vw @ max-width 768px as the screen sizes decreased and images could fill the screen width better. 
![Nav bar not fitting in one line](assets/images/nav-bar-not-fitting.png)
- Once i began trying the site on different size screens it was clear the nav bar wasnt going to fit and it pushed itself down under the explore south africa heading. 
- I had to add a hamburger menu and re-style the header to make sure it had the same colors and style as before. 
- While making the screen smaller the heading for explore south africa also got to big and didnt fit on one line in small screens so I added a media query to make the font-size smaller for smaller screens to allow it to fit on one line. 
- Gallery sections with larger screen didn't work well with 3 columns as the images wouldnt line up properly and kept leaving gaps. 
- I made the column count 4 and the images fitted much better and taller images had space to also display properly. 
- I also used media queries to reduce the column count as the screen got smaller. 
![Gallery not fitting or aligning](assets/images/gallery-not-fitting.png)
- Margin between social media icons was causing one link to be pushed down below the footer container. Using media queries I reduced the margin to let it all fit.
![Social media not fitting](assets/images/social-not-fitting.png)
- The booking form upon re-sizing the screen left a big gap on the left of the screen but was up against the right side of the screen. I changed the margin to make it more central when used on smaller screens. 
![Form not fitting properly](assets/images/booking-form-not-fitting.png)
- the opacity of the booking form was also to clear on smaller screens so I increased mine from 0.6 to 0.8 and found it much better. 
- Originaly i had the four review blocks set to 25vw hoping that would cover the whole container div well, however this did not fit and i had to reduce the width of the containers which has fixed the problem.
![reviews not fitting](assets/images/review-not-fitting.png)
<br>
Other testing was conducted as the code was being written. I would write out code one instruction at a time and test that until what I wanted to achieve was achieved.

## Unfixed Bugs ##
* Hamburger menu on booking page opens behind the form. Tried using different containers and styling to change this but could not get it to change.

#### Reason Bugs aren't Fixed ####
    - Error with anchor element as decendant of button, left unchanged because I need the button to be a clickable link.
    - Duplicate image id was used because I wanted to style multiple images with the same styling.
    - Duplicate r-text id was used because there are multiple text paragraphs that I wanted to style the same. 
    -Used h1 not only for top level heading but further down in the page to maintain consistent styling of heading through the page.
