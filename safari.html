                Tucked into the edge of a dappled forest in the north of Hendo Private Game Reserve, lies Hendo Homestead, 
                a gracious sole-use safari villa, complete with a dedicated ranger, tracker, butler and chef.

        <p> 
            Hendo Private Game Reserve encompasses an impressive 29 866 ha (73 800 acres) of protected wildlife land in KwaZulu-Natal,
            South Africa. Showcasing one of the continent's finest game viewing experiences, 
            the reserve is home to Africa’s Big Five (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhino), as well as 436 bird species.
            <br>
            Blending seamlessly into the natural surroundings, and designed like a contemporary bush farmhouse, 
            Hendo Homestead is an elegant and homely sole-use villa, ideal for both families and small groups. 
            Four private bedrooms and spacious bathrooms fuse harmoniously with the cool, expansive, and inviting guest spaces.
            An interactive kitchen brings the lodge’s private chef into the centre of the guest experience, 
            while a fully equipped private gym and spa allow for relaxation between safaris. 
            Game drive times, as well as meals, are tailored completely to your preference to create a fully personalised safari.
            <br>
            Choose from a range of exciting Adventures such as specialist walking and tracking safaris, 
            a sleepout under the stars, and other participative conservation experiences, such as rhino notching or pangolin tagging. 
            Also on offer and within easy access of the reserve, are Zulu village tours, Africa Foundation community visits and
            a Maputaland exploration. 
            <br>
            Specialist safaris can be arranged in advance and these focus on special interests such as birding, photographic, family and private safaris.
